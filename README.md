### Description

Allows you to accept multiple winsock connections! Great for beginners to intermediate! I know, still some bugs, but overall some nice coding. Uses TCP/IP connection, not UDP! Take a look, comments up the wazoo on this one =)<br>

This would be wonderful if you want to create your own gaming server, chat server, or just a file server!<br><br>

PS - Guess what, guys?! In my code, when the server "broadcasts" a message, I have a doevents in the loop. This is because of a problem with the winsock control that the doevents fixes. HOWEVER! Service pack 4 fixes this. So d/l service pack 4 and remove the doevents from the "broadcast" loop, and have instantaneous broadcasting!!!
